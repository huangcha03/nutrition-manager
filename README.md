# nutrition-manager

Welcome to my full-stack nutrition and foods manager application. This repository houses the source code for both frontend and backend to the application.

- Tech stack uses java, SpringBoot, and SQL for backend and database logistics. Frontend is managed with React, JavaScript, HTML/CSS, and uses Hibernate and REST API to communicate with the database via the backend.
**Please note the frontend code was lost during a computer crash, and will be updated and uploaded here soon**
